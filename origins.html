    <p>The International Society for Universal Dialogue was founded in Warsaw, Poland in 1989. ISUD is a 
       philosophical society dedicated to promoting international and intercultural dialogue among an ever-wider 
       segment of humanity.
    </p>
    <p>The main purpose of the society is to pursue, by means of scholarly work, the gradual realization of a decent, 
       peaceful, and just world order. Towards this goal, ISUD produces biannual international conferences to 
       facilitate an ethos of universal dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>ISUD is committed to promoting philosophical discourse intended to encourage the emergence of a more decent 
       and humane world order by promoting dialogue to actualize the highest and richest human values in all 
       dimensions of life.
    </p>
    <p>ISUD is a member of the International Federation of Philosophical Societies (FISP), is an international 
       association of philosophers and scholars from a wide range of other disciplines (such as history, archaeology, 
       pedagogy, anthropology, etc) devoted to promoting the discussion of such fundamental issues as world peace, 
       social justice, human rights, and dialogical interrelations of diverse cultures.

    <h2 class="about_top">Pawel Kuczynski: Artistic Videographer of ISUD</h2>
    <p>Pawel Kuczynski is the director and producer of many documentary and fiction films. He received his PhD from 
       the prestigious Polish Films School in Lodz, Poland.
    </p>
    <p>In 1991, Pawel began to systematically document the intellectual and moral ethos of the International Society 
       for Universal Dialogue. His efforts to record the intellectual life of the society have produced a rich library 
       documenting key moments of ISUD World Congresses as well as the deliberations, lectures, and interviews with 
       society members. Through these intellectual and artistic efforts Pawel has established himself as ISUD’s 
       “artistic videographer.”
    </p>
    <p>His 2004 film, “Philosopher’s Paradise” focuses on his personal relationship with his father, Janusz Kuczynski, 
       Founder of ISUD. His 2007 film, “Light Denied” blends documentary and fiction film while including a variety of 
       ISUD members—both in personal interviews and as characters interacting with fictitious characters to elucidate 
       the ideas of Frederick Nietzsche. His 2008 film “Phenomenology of Truth” also includes ISUD members. More details 
       concerning Pawel’s work can be found at <a href="https://directing.com/">directing.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Pawel’s works in progress include a film tentatively titled as “Philosophical Friends, The Story of a Dream.” This 
       film depicts the legacy of his father’s relationship with his friend and colleague Jens Jacobsen while re-counting 
       two decades of ISUD efforts to present its vision of a more humane world through the activity of inter-cultural 
       dialogue. Selected videos from his on-going project to document and highlight the promise and vision of the 
       International Society for Universal Dialogue can be viewed on Pawel’s YouTube channel:
