    <h2 class="about_top">Our Origin Story as told by Charles Brown</h2>
    <p>The founding of the first International Society for Universalism–Later named International Society for 
      Universal Dialogue–emerged at the dramatic moment of the opening of the Berlin Wall that had separated Eastern 
      Germany from Western Germany within its traditional capital city. That historic act took place as international 
      scholars from Asia, Europe, China, the Americas, and Africa were invited by Janusz Kucziński to a symposium held 
      in Warsaw (1989) to discuss his vision for international philosophical research that would lead “a cooperative 
      search for shared meaning and values”. [ Kuczyński, J. 1989 Dialogue and Universalism as a New Way of Thinking. 
      The University of Warsaw, Philosophy of Peace Research Project, 62.]
    </p>
    <p>Among our founding scholars, academics invited by Kucziński, was Charles Brown of Emporia University, Kansas. 
      Brown recalls: “Kuczyński’s new form of universalism began with the recognition and reconciliation of 
      antagonistic perspectives, ideologies, and schools of philosophy through a radically inclusive dialogue that 
      offered resistance to the final discourses and pre-mature epistemic closure of previous modes of thinking. This 
      form of universalism must be ‘open in order to sum up dialectically common values and be tolerant towards 
      differentiated and antagonistic values.’ [ibid.] Kuczyński claimed that this new form of universalism begins in 
      dialogue with pluralism--not to destroy or replace that pluralism but to give voice to the differences that 
      define us…”. [Brown, C. First Impressions, Lasting Memories: As I Remember Dialogue and Universalism No. 2/2020]
    </p>
    <p>Leading up to Poland’s ejection of communist rule, it “had been caught up in a great struggle between two 
      opposing social institutions with universalist and hegemonic ideologies: Communism and Catholicism. Po prostu 
      [Straight Talk, an anti-Stalinist journal dating to the 1950s and abolished in 1957] had accomplished the 
      impossible and launched a productive and public dialogue between Marxism and Christianity, a dialogue in search 
      of a common core of values from which to make commensurable discourse possible between Marxists and 
      Christians.”[Ibid.] 
    </p>

      2/2020 of the ISUD’s journal, Dialogue and Universalism, available with open access at ceeol.com, The Central 
      and Eastern European Online Library.

    <h2 class="about_top">Pawel Kuczynski: Artistic Videographer of ISUD</h2>
    <p>Pawel Kuczynski is the director and producer of many documentary and fiction films. He received his PhD from 
       the prestigious Polish Films School in Lodz, Poland.
    </p>
    <p>In 1991, Pawel began to systematically document the intellectual and moral ethos of the International Society 
       for Universal Dialogue. His efforts to record the intellectual life of the society have produced a rich library 
       documenting key moments of ISUD World Congresses as well as the deliberations, lectures, and interviews with 
       society members. Through these intellectual and artistic efforts Pawel has established himself as ISUD’s 
       “artistic videographer.”
    </p>
    <p>His 2004 film, “Philosopher’s Paradise” focuses on his personal relationship with his father, Janusz Kuczynski, 
       Founder of ISUD. His 2007 film, “Light Denied” blends documentary and fiction film while including a variety of 
       ISUD members—both in personal interviews and as characters interacting with fictitious characters to elucidate 
       the ideas of Frederick Nietzsche. His 2008 film “Phenomenology of Truth” also includes ISUD members. More details 
       concerning Pawel’s work can be found at <a href="https://directing.com/">directing.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Pawel’s works in progress include a film tentatively titled as “Philosophical Friends, The Story of a Dream.” This 
       film depicts the legacy of his father’s relationship with his friend and colleague Jens Jacobsen while re-counting 
       two decades of ISUD efforts to present its vision of a more humane world through the activity of inter-cultural 
       dialogue. Selected videos from his on-going project to document and highlight the promise and vision of the 
       International Society for Universal Dialogue can be viewed on Pawel’s YouTube channel:
